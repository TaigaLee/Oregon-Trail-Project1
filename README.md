Game idea: Create a mini version of the classic game Oregon Trail where the player and their pioneer family embarks on a trip to Oregon. Along the way the player is met with decisions that will affect their progress and are tasked with the responsibilities of making sure they don’t run out of food and keeping their family safe/healthy.

User story:
Player starts at max stats and at the beginning of the map. They have the option of whether to run, walk normally, or walk slowly. Dependent on each choice they will lose stamina more or less quickly. They will auto walk without requiring key input.

Players will lose food, wagon hp, and stamina as time goes on.

Players will occasionally have the pop up on if they want to hunt to get more food. If they click yes the game will randomly decide whether they succeeded or not.

When players reach a city (undecided how many at this point, 2?) they have the chance to stock up on food in the general stores and make money by staying additional days (which increases the chance that they won’t make it to Oregon by winter which = death).
Players will be tasked with selecting yes or no on random interactions such as “open the random box?” or “take the shorter path?” Decisions made will impact game.

User can die of illness, starvation, or if the game hits winter. His family will die first.

The user will win the game after travelling 500 miles (traveling 15 miles a day, ~ 30 days of regular paced walking). Winter comes after 38 days.
